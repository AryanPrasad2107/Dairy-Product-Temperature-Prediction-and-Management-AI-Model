Project Title:-  "Environment system to tune the Room temprature according to products and extrernal temperature"

Description:-The dairy industry handles a wide range of temperature-sensitive products such as milk, curd, butter, cheese, ice-cream and flavored dairy beverages. These products must be stored and transported under controlled temperature conditions (cold chain) to maintain their safety, quality, and shelf life. Any deviation from the required temperature during supply — due to inadequate refrigeration, equipment failure, or delays — can lead to spoilage, microbial growth, product recalls, and consumer health risks. This challenge is critical for both raw material reception and finished product distribution.
